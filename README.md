# Wumpdump

Welcome to Wumpdump, a batch script designed to help you clean up cache files generated by Discord on your Windows computer.

## Getting Started

To use Wumpdump, simply follow these instructions:

1. **[Click Here](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/danielytuk/Discord-Cache-Cleaner/main/wumpdump.bat)** to download the script file.
2. Choose a suitable location on your computer, preferably by creating a new folder.
3. Run the downloaded script file and let Wumpdump work its magic! ðŸ˜‰

## Dependencies

Wumpdump requires the following dependencies to function properly:

- [trid](https://mark0.net/download/trid.html) - A file identifier tool used to analyze file types.
- [quiet](https://www.joeware.net/freetools/tools/quiet/index.htm) - A command-line tool for launching processes silently.

Don't worry, Wumpdump will automatically download and set up these dependencies in a newly created `deps` directory.

## How It Works

When you execute Wumpdump, it performs the following actions:

- Downloads the necessary dependencies (trid and quiet).
- Extracts the downloaded files into the `deps` directory.
- Copies the cache files from Discord's appdata directories to the `cached_files` directory.
- Uses `trid` to analyze and identify the file types in the `cached_files` directory.
- Deletes the cache files from Discord's appdata directories.

Before running Wumpdump, please ensure that Discord is already installed on your system.

**Note:** Wumpdump operates on the following Discord directories:
- `%appdata%\discord`
- `%appdata%\discordptb`
- `%appdata%\discordcanary`
- `%appdata%\discorddevelopment`
